This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with the error message "FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.". The exception message is not very helpful and does not provide any specific information about the cause of the error. This bug seems to only occur on some machines, and it is not clear what causes it. It might be related to the environment variables or some other system setting.
